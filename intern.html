<h1>Research Fellowship</h1>
</div>
<h2><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research Lab, India</a></h2>
<p>I worked as a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-natural-language-systems-and-applications/">Machine Learning, Natural Language Systems and Applications</a> group at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research India</a>. I work under the guidance of <a href="http://www.prateekjain.org/">Dr Prateek Jain</a>, <a href="http://praneethnetrapalli.org/">Dr Praneeth Netrapalli</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZBkUp20AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr Nagarajan Natarajan</a> on problems related to machine learning and natural language processing.</p>
<h1>Internships</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.techatbloomberg.com/ai/">Bloomberg AI, New York (virtual)</a></h2>
<p>I worked with the IE and KG team on trsutworthy and interpretable tabular reasoning approches. Publication under preperation for a top-tier NLP conference.</p>
<h2><a href="https://ai.facebook.com">Facebook AI Research, Seattle, Washington (virtual)</a></h2>
<p>I worked on efficient and effective semantic parsing for a task-oriented dialogues system. Publication under review at top-tier NLP conference.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/">IBM Research, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, New York</a></h2>
<p>I worked on generating interpretable explanation for Natural Language Task. Speciffically, I worked on Generating Contrastive Explanations for Natural Language Processing. The idea is the closest meaning attribute whose present and absence are necessary to explain the model prediction. The method has a close connection of the topic with Adversarial Learning and Counterfactual Explanations. We proposed an edit based controlled paraphrase model with topic modelling based interpretable attribute to handle the above challenges. I work under the guidance of Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Pin-Yu Chen, Ioana Baldini, Prasanna Sattigeri, Ronny Luss, Amit Dhurandhar, Kush R Varshney.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research Lab, India</a></h2>
<p>I worked on Efficient Estimation of generalization error, bias and variance component of ensemble classifiers. Our method provide a technique for efficient estimation of classification score using only a required bare minimum number of base classifiers. I was mentored by Dr. Sundararajan Sellamanickam (Microsoft Research) and Dr. Dhruv Mahajan (Facebook Research). I also receive a Research Fellowship offer in the end of internship.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.flipkart.com/">Flipkart Internet Private Ltd, Bangalore</a></h2>
<p>I worked there as a junior researcher with Data Science group during the 4th-year summer on a collaborative project between IIT Kanpur and Flipkart.
