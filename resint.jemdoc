= Research Interests

I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning, speciallaly statistical and computational intricacy relevant to the use of machine learning. In my time at Microsoft Research and at IIT Kanpur, I have had the chance to explore both practical and theoretical problems in machine learning. I am also currently co-advising few student at IIT Kanpur jointly with [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~hk/ Prof. Harish Karnick], [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/ Prof Piyush Rai]  and [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/ Prof Purushottam Kar]. \n \n Mission: Make Machine Smarter !! Solve Intelligence. Uses the best technique in Machine Learning to build powerful general-purpose algorithms.
