= About Me
I will be soon joining [https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/ Cognitive Computation Group] at [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/ UPenn CIS] school to work with [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/ Prof. Dan Roth] as a PostDoctoral Researcher. Will also engage with [https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/ Penn NLP] and [https://priml.upenn.edu/ PRiML] (ML group). Consider joining [https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/ CCG] or [https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/ Penn NLP] as Ph.D. or MS student.
\n\n
I obtained my Ph.D. at the [http://www.cs.utah.edu/ Kahlert School of Computing], [https://www.utah.edu/ University of Utah] advised by [https://svivek.com/ Prof. Vivek Srikumar]. I was the member of the [https://nlp.cs.utah.edu/people/ Utah NLP Group], coordinator of the [http://datascience.utah.edu/club.html Utah Data Science Club] (part of [http://datascience.utah.edu Utah Data Science Center]), and involved with [http://datascience.utah.edu/seminar.html Utah Data Science Seminar] organization. My research interest are Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, particularly problems incorperating both fields. I was gracefully supported by [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022/ Bloomberg Data Science Fellowship] 2021-2022 (extended till 2023) during my Ph.D.. I also explored topics in fair Machine Learning under the guidance of [http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/ Prof. Suresh Venkatasubramanian] during my Ph.D.. I also work closely with [https://imsure318.github.io/ Shuo Zhang] from Bloomberg AI as part of [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022/ Bloomberg Data Science Fellow].
\n\n
Before that, I was a Research Fellow in the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-natural-language-systems-and-applications/ Machine Learning, Natural Language Systems and Applications] group at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/ Microsoft Research India]. I work under the guidance of [http://www.prateekjain.org/ Dr Prateek Jain], [http://praneethnetrapalli.org/ Dr Praneeth Netrapalli], and [https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZBkUp20AAAAJ&hl=en Dr Nagarajan Natarajan] on problems related to machine learning and natural language processing. 
\n\n 
Previously, I was a student at [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ IIT Kanpur] where I obtained my M. Tech and B. Tech (Dual Degree) in Computer Science in 2016. I worked on Hierarchal Product Classification and Text Document Representation with [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/k/Karnick:Harish Prof. Harish Karnick] for my master thesis. I have also closely worked under the guidance of [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/ Prof Piyush Rai] on the problem of diversity priors for latent variable models and efficient algorithms for multi-label learning. I was also the first coordinator of Special Interest Group Machine Learning ([https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sigml SIGML]) at IIT Kanpur.
\n \n
I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning, especially statistical and computational intricacies relevant to the use of machine learning. Mission: Make machine smarter !! Solve intelligence. Uses the best technique in Machine Learning to build powerful general-purpose algorithms. \n \n 
I have been fortunate to have been advised by smart people. They showed me the light when I was in the dark. In every step, they were there to guide me. They have left a significant mark in my life. \n
