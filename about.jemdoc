= About Me

I am a Research Fellow in the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-natural-language-systems-and-applications/ Machine Learning, Natural Language Systems and Applications] group at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/ Microsoft Research India]. I work under the guidance of [http://www.prateekjain.org/ Dr Prateek Jain], [http://praneethnetrapalli.org/ Dr Praneeth Netrapalli], and [https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZBkUp20AAAAJ&hl=en Dr Nagarajan Natarajan] on problems related to machine learning and natural language processing. 
\n\n 
Previously, I was a student at [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ IIT Kanpur] where I obtained my M. Tech and B. Tech (Dual Degree) in Computer Science in 2016. I worked on Hierarchal Product Classification and Text Document Representation with [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/k/Karnick:Harish Prof. Harish Karnick] for my master thesis. I have also closely worked under the guidance of [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/ Prof Piyush Rai] on the problem of diversity priors for latent variable models and efficient algorithms for multi-label learning. I was also the first coordinator of Special Interest Group Machine Learning ([https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sigml SIGML]) at IIT Kanpur.
\n \n
I am interested in natural language processing and machine learning, especially statistical and computational intricacy relevant to the use of machine learning. Mission: Make Machine Smarter !! Solve Intelligence. Uses the best technique in Machine Learning to build powerful general-purpose algorithms. \n \n 

I have been fortunate to have been advised by smart people. They showed me light when I was in the dark. In every step, they were there to guide me. They have left a significant mark in my life. \n
