I worked on generating interpretable explanation for Natural Language Task. Speciffically, I worked on Generating Contrastive Explanations for Natural Language Processing. The idea is the closest meaning attribute whose present and absence are necessary to explain the model prediction. The method has a close connection of the topic with Adversarial Learning and Counterfactual Explanations. We proposed an edit based controlled paraphrase model with topic modelling based interpretable attribute to handle the above challenges. I work under the guidance of Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Pin-Yu Chen, Ioana Baldini, Prasanna Sattigeri, Ronny Luss, Amit Dhurandhar, Kush R Varshney.
