- *Course Instructor* for [https://nadimgh.github.io/ece367.html /Matrix Algebra and Optimization (ECE367H1)/] at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, in Fall 2024. The course provides students with a grounding in optimization methods and the matrix algebra upon which they are based. Applications from machine learning, signal processing, and engineering are used to illustrate the techniques developed.
- *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for /Topics in Coding Theory (DSC 291)/, under [https://mazumdar.ucsd.edu/ Prof. Arya Mazumdar], at the Department of Data Science, University of California San Diego, in Fall 2022. The course covered various topics in coding theory, including a basic introduction to information theory (soft-packing and Shannon capacity), threshold phenomenon in random graphs, Reed--Solomon and Reed--Muller codes, polar codes, list decoding, and expander codes.
- *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for /Introduction to Data Processing and Information Theory (ECE 154C)/, under [https://tjavidi.eng.ucsd.edu/ Prof. Tara Javidi], at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, in Winter 2020. This course covered the basic concepts of information theory and coding, including lossless compression of discrete sources, lossy representation of continuous variables and forward error correction in noisy channels.
- *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for /Linear Algebra and Applications (ECE 269)/, under [https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/piya-pal/ Prof. Piya Pal], at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, in Fall 2018. The course covered the mathematical foundations of linear algebra.
- *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for /Random Processes (ECE 250)/, under [https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/ Prof. Young-Han Kim], at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, in Spring 2018. The course gave a graduate-level introduction of probability theory to engineering students and covered topics such as convergence of random variables, concentration inequalities, stochastic processes, stationarity and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation.
- *Undergraduate Teaching Assistant* for /Introduction to Programming (ECE 230)/, under [https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=lb13 Prof. Louay Bazzi], at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut (AUB), in Fall 2013. The course is an introductory course to C\+\+ programming.
