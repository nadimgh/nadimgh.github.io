== About Me
I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia, hosted by [https://sites.google.com/site/wanglele1986/ Prof. Lele Wang]. Prior to joining University of British Columbia, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Toronto, hosted by [https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/ Prof. Wei Yu]. I received my Ph.D. in [https://ece.ucsd.edu/ Electrical Engineering] from the University of California San Diego, where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by
  [https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/ Prof. Young-Han Kim] and [http://cwc.ucsd.edu/people/laurence-b-milstein Prof. Laurence B. Milstein]. My research interests lie broadly in the intersections of information theory, wireless communication and signal processing.
