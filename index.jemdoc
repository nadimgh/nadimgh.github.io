\n 
I am a research fellow in the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-natural-language-systems-and-applications/ Machine Learning, Natural Language Systems and Applications] group at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/ Microsoft Research India], where I work with [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/ Dr. Prateek Jain], [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/ Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli] on problem related to machine learning and natural language processing. I also closely interact on ideas with postdoc [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/t-nanata/ Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan].
\n\n 
Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ IIT Kanpur] where I obtained my M. Tech and B. Tech (Dual Degree) in Computer Science in 2016. I worked on Heirarichal Product Classification and Text Document Representation with [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~hk/ Prof. Harish Karnick] for my master thesis. I have also closely worked with [https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/ Prof Piyush Rai] on problem of diversity priors for latent variable models and efficient algorithms for multi-label learning. I was also the first coordinator of Special Interest Group Machine Learning ([https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in SIGML]) at IIT Kanpur.
\n \n
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning, speciallaly statistical and computational intricacy relevant to the use of machine learning. Mission: Make Machine Smarter !! Solve Intelligence. Uses the best technique in Machine Learning to build powerful general-purpose algorithms. \n \n
